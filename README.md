Hello and welcome!

This repository contains SQL queries used in the development of a custom OpEx Dashboard in Tableau.

The queries were written in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio using SQL Server Express.
The datatables were sourced from Microsoft's Learning SQL Docs website: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/ The specific tables from the sample database can be found in the dataset Adventure Works 2019 Sample Dataset

The objective of the queries is to extract meaningful data that can be fed into an informative monthly Operations dashboard. The dashboard's aim is to inform plant leadership of the status of monthly KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), both for recent and moving average month data over time. Additionally, results from the queries should be manipulable to identify parts and processes with the highest monthly Quality, Cost, and Delivery issues. This allows technical support and sustaining engineering teams to carry out continuous improvement initiatives with the highest impact to the business.

The Tableau Monthly Ops Dashboard can be found on my Tableau Public page: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.brown7604/viz/MonthlyOpsDashboard/OpExDash_1

Thank you!
